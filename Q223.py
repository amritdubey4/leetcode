LeetCode Q223: Rectangle Area
Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.
The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its top-right corner (ax2, ay2).
The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its top-right corner (bx2, by2).
