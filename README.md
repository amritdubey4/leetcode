# LeetCode Solutions — Python

A concise, well-structured collection of Python solutions to LeetCode problems. Each solution is stored in its own file, organized by problem number for quick lookup and testing.

**Why this repo?**
- Curated, readable Python solutions with clear naming.
- Great for interview prep, study, or building patterns.

**Structure**
- Files follow the pattern: `Q{n}.py` → e.g., [Q2.py](Q2.py)
- Each file contains a focused solution for the LeetCode problem and a simple example or `__main__` test.

**Quick Start**
- Run a single solution (example):

```bash
python Q2.py
```

- Import and use a function from a file:

```bash
python -c "from Q2 import addTwoNumbers; print(addTwoNumbers(...))"
```

**Requirements**
- Python 3.8+ (recommended)

**Contributing**
- Add or improve solutions via pull requests.
- Use clear variable names and include an example/test in `if __name__ == '__main__'`.

**License & Contact**
- No license specified. If you want one, add MIT/Apache and a CONTRIBUTING guide.
- Questions? Open an issue or a PR.

Happy coding! 🚀
