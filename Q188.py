LeetCode Q188: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer k.
Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions.
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
