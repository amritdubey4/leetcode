LeetCode Q207: Course Schedule
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. 
You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi 
first if you want to take course ai.
For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.
