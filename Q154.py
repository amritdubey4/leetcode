LeetCode Q154: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. 
For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:
- [4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
- [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.
You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.
